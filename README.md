# Tropical cyclones interactive map


This is an interactive map of several tropical cyclones made using Google Maps API.
The polygons are draggable and change according to the real size of the surface
(read more on [Mercator projection] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection)).
The aim is to show how big the tropical cyclones really are.

Hovering over the polygons shows an weather image of the tropical cyclone.
